## Take-home exam 

* Create a front-end application with React that pulls the data (JSON) and displays it in a
scatter plot. Each point represents one of the 1473 cells colored by cell type.
* When mousing over a cell, have a tool tip appear with the corresponding cell name and
cell type from the JSON file.
* Add a legend matching the colors to the cell type values.
Note: The application does not have to have any type of user log in; just simply display
the plot and legend when you run it.
